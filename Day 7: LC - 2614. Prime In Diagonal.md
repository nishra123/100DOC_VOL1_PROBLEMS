You are given a 0-indexed two-dimensional integer array nums.

Return the largest prime number that lies on at least one of the diagonals of nums. In case, no prime is present on any of the diagonals, return 0.

Note that:

An integer is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.
An integer val is on one of thediagonals of nums if there exists an integer i for which nums[i][i] = val or an i for which nums[i][nums.length - i - 1]= val.


In the above diagram, one diagonal is [1,5,9] and another diagonal is [3,5,7].

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[5,6,7],[9,10,11]]
Output: 11
Explanation: The numbers 1, 3, 6, 9, and 11 are the only numbers present on at least one of the diagonals. Since 11 is the largest prime, we return 11.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[5,17,7],[9,11,10]]
Output: 17
Explanation: The numbers 1, 3, 9, 10, and 17 are all present on at least one of the diagonals. 17 is the largest prime, so we return 17.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 300
nums.length == numsi.length
1 <= nums[i][j] <= 4*10^6

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int diagonalPrime(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(), largestPrime = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // assigning diagonal elements
            int val1 = nums[i][i], val2 = nums[i][n-i-1];
            // using function to calculate max of prime number
            if (isPrime(val1)) largestPrime = max(largestPrime, val1);
            if (isPrime(val2)) largestPrime = max(largestPrime, val2);
        }
        return largestPrime;
    }
    
    bool isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return false;
        if (n <= 3) return true;
        if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return false;
        // we loop through potential factors of n in increments of 6 (since all primes greater than 3 are either of the form 6k+1 or 6k-1) up to the square root of n. We check if n is divisible by either the current potential factor or the potential factor plus 2. If n is divisible by either of these, we return false. Otherwise, we return true.
        for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6) {
            if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
