In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.

The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise one of the two rights:

Ban one senator's right: A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.
Announce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.
Given a string senate representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.

The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.

Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party. Predict which party will finally announce the victory and change the Dota2 game. The output should be "Radiant" or "Dire".

 

Example 1:

Input: senate = "RD"
Output: "Radiant"
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And in round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.
Example 2:

Input: senate = "RDD"
Output: "Dire"
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And the third senator comes from Dire and he can ban the first senator's right in round 1. 
And in round 2, the third senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.
 

Constraints:

n == senate.length
1 <= n <= 104
senate[i] is either 'R' or 'D'.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  string predictPartyVictory(string senate) {

    // Number of Senators
    int n = senate.size();

    // To mark Banned Senators
    vector<bool> banned(n, false);

    // List of indices of Eligible Radiant and Dire Senators
    vector<int> rIndices, dIndices;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (senate[i] == 'R')
        rIndices.push_back(i);
      else
        dIndices.push_back(i);
    }

    // Ban the senator of "indices" array next to "startAt"
    auto ban = [&](vector<int> &indices, int start_at) {
      // Find the index of "index of senator to ban" using Binary Search
      auto temp = lower_bound(indices.begin(), indices.end(), start_at);

      // If start_at is more than the last index,
      // then start from the beginning. Ban the first senator
      if (temp == indices.end()) {
        banned[indices[0]] = true;
        indices.erase(indices.begin());
      }

      // Else, Ban the senator at the index
      else {
        banned[*temp] = true;
        indices.erase(temp);
      }
    };

    // Turn of Senator at this Index
    int turn = 0;

    // While both parties have at least one senator 
    while (!rIndices.empty() && !dIndices.empty()) {

      if (!banned[turn]) {
        // If the current senator is Radiant, ban a Dire senator.
        if (senate[turn] == 'R')
          ban(dIndices, turn);
        // If the current senator is Dire, ban a Radiant senator.
        else
          ban(rIndices, turn);
      }

      // Increment the turn to move to the next senator.
      turn = (turn + 1) % n;
    }

    // Return the winning party.
    return dIndices.empty() ? "Radiant" : "Dire";
  }
};
```

INSIGHTS - Binary search is used in the `ban` function to find the index of the senator to be banned. In each round, the `ban` function is called with the list of indices of the eligible senators of the party whose turn it is and the index of the senator who will be banned next.

The `lower_bound` function from the C++ STL algorithm library is used to find the index of the senator who will be banned. It returns an iterator to the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the given value. Since the list is sorted in increasing order, this iterator can be used to find the index of the senator to be banned. If the iterator points to the end of the list, it means that the senator to be banned is the first senator in the list (since the list is circular), so the function deletes the first element of the list. Otherwise, it deletes the senator at the index pointed to by the iterator.
