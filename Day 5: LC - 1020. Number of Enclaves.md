You are given an m x n binary matrix grid, where 0 represents a sea cell and 1 represents a land cell.

A move consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (4-directionally) land cell or walking off the boundary of the grid.

Return the number of land cells in grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.

 

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three 1s that are enclosed by 0s, and one 1 that is not enclosed because its on the boundary.
Example 2:


Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: All 1s are either on the boundary or can reach the boundary.
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 500
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.


INSIGHTS - I had to refer solution for this as it involved Depth First Search!

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int closedIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        // Get the number of rows and columns in the grid.
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        // Initialize a counter for the number of closed islands.
        int count = 0;
        
        // Initialize a 2D boolean vector to keep track of visited cells.
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
        
        // Loop through each cell in the grid.
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // If the cell is water (0) and hasn't been visited yet, then it's a potential closed island.
                if (grid[i][j] == 0 && !visited[i][j]) {
                    // Call the dfs function to check if the island is closed.
                    bool is_closed = dfs(grid, visited, i, j, m, n);
                    
                    // If the island is closed, increment the counter.
                    if (is_closed) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Return the number of closed islands.
        return count;
    }
    
    // Recursive function to check if the island is closed.
    bool dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<bool>>& visited, int i, int j, int m, int n) {
        // If the current cell is outside the grid, it's not a closed island.
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= m || j >= n) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // If the current cell has already been visited or is land (1), then it's not a closed island.
        if (visited[i][j] || grid[i][j] == 1) {
            return true;
        }
    
        // Mark the current cell as visited.
        visited[i][j] = true;
        
        // Recursively call dfs on the neighboring cells.
        bool up = dfs(grid, visited, i-1, j, m, n);
        bool down = dfs(grid, visited, i+1, j, m, n);
        bool left = dfs(grid, visited, i, j-1, m, n);
        bool right = dfs(grid, visited, i, j+1, m, n);
        
        // If any of the neighboring cells are not closed islands, then this cell is also not a closed island.
        return up && down && left && right;
    }
};
