There are n piles of coins on a table. Each pile consists of a positive number of coins of assorted denominations.

In one move, you can choose any coin on top of any pile, remove it, and add it to your wallet.

Given a list piles, where piles[i] is a list of integers denoting the composition of the ith pile from top to bottom, and a positive integer k, return the maximum total value of coins you can have in your wallet if you choose exactly k coins optimally.

 

Example 1:


Input: piles = [[1,100,3],[7,8,9]], k = 2
Output: 101
Explanation:
The above diagram shows the different ways we can choose k coins.
The maximum total we can obtain is 101.
Example 2:

Input: piles = [[100],[100],[100],[100],[100],[100],[1,1,1,1,1,1,700]], k = 7
Output: 706
Explanation:
The maximum total can be obtained if we choose all coins from the last pile.
 

Constraints:

n == piles.length
1 <= n <= 1000
1 <= piles[i][j] <= 105
1 <= k <= sum(piles[i].length) <= 2000


INSIGHTS - solved it using dp.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxValueOfCoins(vector<vector<int>>& piles, int k) {
        // Get the number of piles.
        int n = piles.size();
        // Initialize a 2D vector dp with all values set to 0.
        vector dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1));
        
        // Loop over the piles.
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // Loop over the number of coins that can be taken.
            for (int coins = 0; coins <= k; coins++) {
                // Initialize the sum of the current pile to 0.
                int currentSum = 0;
                // Loop over the number of coins that can be taken from the current pile.
                for (int currentCoins = 0; currentCoins <= min((int)piles[i - 1].size(), coins); currentCoins++) {
                    // If there is at least one coin to be taken, add its value to the current sum.
                    if (currentCoins > 0) {
                        currentSum += piles[i - 1][currentCoins - 1];
                    }
                    // Update the maximum value that can be obtained using the current pile and number of coins.
                    dp[i][coins] = max(dp[i][coins], dp[i - 1][coins - currentCoins] + currentSum);
                }
            }
        }
        // Return the maximum value that can be obtained using the first n piles and k coins.
        return dp[n][k];
    }
};
```
