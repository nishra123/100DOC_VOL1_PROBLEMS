Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
0 <= k <= 10^5


INSIGHTS - In tgis question it was easy to use a hashmap, but this insight of using nested loops with specifying exactly that value for which how many times the inner loop should run, was really great - even when constraints were too large!

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool containsNearbyDuplicate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int i,j, n=nums.size();
        // make another array for removing duplicates 
        vector<int> sol=nums;
        sort(sol.begin(), sol.end());
        sol.erase(unique(sol.begin(), sol.end()), sol.end());
        int q=sol.size();
        // if after removing duplicates size is same as original, return false
        if(n==q){
            return false;
        }
        for(i=0; i<n; i++){
            // specify maximum limit for how many times the inner loop should run
            int max_limit = min(n, i+k+1);
            // apply given condition
            for(j=i+1; j<max_limit; j++){
                if(nums[i]==nums[j]){
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

Here,
int max_limit = min(variable1, i+k+1); is used to calculate the upper limit of the inner loop that checks for duplicate values in the nums vector.

The value of max_limit is set to the minimum of two numbers:

variable1: the total number of elements in the nums vector
i + k + 1: the maximum index up to which the inner loop should run.
Here, i is the current index of the outer loop, and k is the maximum allowed difference between two indices. Therefore, i + k + 1 gives the maximum index beyond which the inner loop would not find any elements with the same value as nums[i].

By taking the minimum of variable1 and i + k + 1, we ensure that the inner loop doesn't go beyond the end of the nums vector. This is necessary because if the inner loop goes beyond the end of the vector, we would be accessing memory that does not belong to the vector, which can cause undefined behavior or even crash the program.

So, the min function is used to make sure that we are checking only valid indices in the nums vector.
