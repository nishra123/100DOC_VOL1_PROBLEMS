Given a string s, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than once.

Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.

Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 4
Explanation:
Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.
Example 2:

Input: s = "ssssss"
Output: 6
Explanation:
The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only English lowercase letters.


INSIGHTS - I solved this question by referring to the editorial algo


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int partitionString(string s) {
        // create a vector lastSeen and fill it with -1
        vector <int> lastSeen(26, -1);
        int i;
        int count=1 , substringStart=0;
        int n=s.length();
        for(i=0; i<n; i++){
            // subtract first character from lastSeen 
            if(lastSeen[s[i]-'a']>=substringStart){
                count+=1;
                substringStart=i;
            }
            lastSeen[s[i]-'a']=i;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
