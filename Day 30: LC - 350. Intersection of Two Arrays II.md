Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000
 

Follow up:

What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> intersect(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
        sort(nums2.begin(), nums2.end());
        vector<int> ans;
        // putting set intersection of given two vectors in ans
        set_intersection(nums1.begin(), nums1.end(), nums2.begin(), nums2.end() , back_inserter(ans));
        return ans;
    }
};
```

If the given array is already sorted, we can optimize the algorithm by avoiding the sort step and directly using the two-pointer technique to find the intersection.

If nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size, we can optimize the algorithm by using the smaller array for building a hash set and iterating through the larger array to find the intersection. This would save time and space complexity.

If elements of nums2 are stored on disk and the memory is limited, we can use an external sort to sort the arrays, then use a two-pointer technique or hash set to find the intersection. We can also process the arrays in chunks, loading only a part of the array into memory at a time. This would require multiple passes over the data, but would allow us to process the data in limited memory.
