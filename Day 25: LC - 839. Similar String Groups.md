Two strings X and Y are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of X, so that it equals Y. Also two strings X and Y are similar if they are equal.

For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.  Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.

We are given a list strs of strings where every string in strs is an anagram of every other string in strs. How many groups are there?

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["omv","ovm"]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 300
1 <= strs[i].length <= 300
strs[i] consists of lowercase letters only.
All words in strs have the same length and are anagrams of each other.


INSIGHTS - This problem can be solved using either of the breadth-first search or depth-first search, but I found out that it can also be solved using a data structure called Union Find; which is done by the following way:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class UnionFind {
public:
    UnionFind(int n) {
        // Initialize parent array with each element as its own parent
        parent.resize(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
        count = n;
    }
    
    int find(int x) {
        // Find the root of the group that x belongs to
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // Path compression optimization
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
    
    void merge(int x, int y) {
        // Merge the groups that x and y belong to
        int px = find(x); // Find root of group containing x
        int py = find(y); // Find root of group containing y
        if (px != py) {
            parent[px] = py; // Make the root of x's group point to the root of y's group
            count--; // Decrement the number of distinct groups
        }
    }
    
    int getCount() {
        // Return the number of distinct groups
        return count;
    }
    
private:
    vector<int> parent; // Parent array to store the parent of each element
    int count; // Number of distinct groups
};

class Solution {
public:
    int numSimilarGroups(vector<string>& strs) {
        int n = strs.size();
        UnionFind uf(n); // Initialize UnionFind object with n elements
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (isSimilar(strs[i], strs[j])) { // If the strings are similar, merge them
                    uf.merge(i, j);
                }
            }
        }
        return uf.getCount(); // Return the number of distinct groups
    }
    
private:
    bool isSimilar(string& s1, string& s2) {
        int n = s1.size();
        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s1[i] != s2[i]) {
                diff++;
            }
            if (diff > 2) { // If the number of differing characters is greater than 2, the strings are not similar
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true; // The strings are similar if the number of differing characters is at most 2
    }
};
```
