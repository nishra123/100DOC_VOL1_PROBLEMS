Given two integer arrays pushed and popped each with distinct values, return true if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4),
pop() -> 4,
push(5),
pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
Example 2:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.
 

Constraints:

1 <= pushed.length <= 1000
0 <= pushed[i] <= 1000
All the elements of pushed are unique.
popped.length == pushed.length
popped is a permutation of pushed.


```cpp
bool validateStackSequences(vector<int>& pushed, vector<int>& popped) {
    stack<int> s; // initialize a stack to simulate push and pop operations
    int i = 0; // pointer for the pushed array
    for (int x : pushed) { // iterate through each element in the pushed array
        s.push(x); // push the element onto the stack
        while (!s.empty() && s.top() == popped[i]) { // while the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack matches the current element in the popped array
            s.pop(); // pop the top element from the stack
            i++; // increment the pointer for the popped array
        }
    }
    return s.empty(); // return true if the stack is empty, false otherwise
}
```
