You are given a list of strings of the same length words and a string target.

Your task is to form target using the given words under the following rules:

target should be formed from left to right.
To form the ith character (0-indexed) of target, you can choose the kth character of the jth string in words if target[i] = words[j][k].
Once you use the kth character of the jth string of words, you can no longer use the xth character of any string in words where x <= k. In other words, all characters to the left of or at index k become unusuable for every string.
Repeat the process until you form the string target.
Notice that you can use multiple characters from the same string in words provided the conditions above are met.

Return the number of ways to form target from words. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["acca","bbbb","caca"], target = "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 ways to form target.
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
Example 2:

Input: words = ["abba","baab"], target = "bab"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 ways to form target.
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 2 ("abba")
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
"bab" -> index 1 ("abba"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
All strings in words have the same length.
1 <= target.length <= 1000
words[i] and target contain only lowercase English letters.

INSIGHTS - Solved it using dp!

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWays(vector<string>& words, string target) {
        // Initialize some constants
        const int alphabet = 26; // number of characters in the English alphabet
        const int mod = 1e9 + 7; // the number by which we will take the remainder to avoid overflow
        int m = target.size(), k = words[0].size(); // the length of target and each word in words

        // Count the number of occurrences of each character in each position of words
        vector cnt(alphabet, vector<int>(k)); // cnt[i][j] = number of occurrences of character i + 'a' in position j of words
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            for (const string& word : words) {
                cnt[word[j] - 'a'][j]++;
            }
        }

        // Use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to form target from words
        vector dp(m + 1, vector<long long>(k + 1)); // dp[i][j] = number of ways to form the first i characters of target using the first j characters of words
        dp[0][0] = 1; // we can always form an empty string using the empty string
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
                // If we are not yet done forming target, we can use the jth character of words to form the (i+1)th character of target
                if (i < m) {
                    (dp[i + 1][j + 1] += cnt[target[i] - 'a'][j] * dp[i][j]) %= mod;
                    // The number of ways to form the (i+1)th character of target using the jth character of words is equal to the number of occurrences of target[i] in the jth position of words, times the number of ways to form the first i characters of target using the first j characters of words
                }
                // Regardless of whether we used the jth character of words, we can move on to the next character of words
                (dp[i][j + 1] += dp[i][j]) %= mod;
                // The number of ways to form the first i characters of target using the first (j+1) characters of words is equal to the number of ways to form the first i characters of target using the first j characters of words plus the number of ways to form the first i characters of target using the first (j+1) characters of words
            }
        }

        return dp[m][k]; // The answer is the number of ways to form the entire target string using all the words in words
    }
};
