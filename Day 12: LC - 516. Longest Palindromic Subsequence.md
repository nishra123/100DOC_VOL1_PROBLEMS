Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists only of lowercase English letters.

INSIGHTS - Approach: Dynamic Programming!

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindromeSubseq(string s) {
        int n = s.size(); // get the length of the input string
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n)); // create a 2D vector to store DP values

        // Iterate over the DP table from the bottom right corner to the top left corner
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Every character is a palindrome of length 1, so set dp[i][i] to 1
            dp[i][i] = 1;
            
            // Iterate over the cells in the current row, from i+1 to n-1
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                // If the characters at s[i] and s[j] are the same, add 2 to the length of the palindrome
                if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2;
                } 
                // Otherwise, take the maximum of the lengths of the palindromes obtained by either
                // including the ith character or excluding the jth character
                else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        // The length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the entire string is stored in dp[0][n-1]
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
};
```
