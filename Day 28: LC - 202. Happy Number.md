Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        // We use an unordered set to keep track of the numbers we have encountered
        // If we encounter a number that we have already seen, we know that we are in a cycle
        // and can return false
        unordered_set<int> seen;
        
        // Continue iterating until we either reach 1 (a happy number) or encounter a cycle
        while(n != 1){
            int sum = 0;
            
            // Calculate the sum of the squares of the digits of n
            while(n != 0){
                int digit = n % 10;
                sum += digit * digit;
                n /= 10;
            }
            
            // If we have already seen this sum, we are in a cycle and can return false
            if(seen.count(sum)) return false;
            
            // Otherwise, add this sum to the set of seen numbers
            seen.insert(sum);
            
            // Update n with the new sum and continue iterating
            n = sum;
        }
        
        // If we reach here, n has reached 1 and is a happy number
        return true;
    }
