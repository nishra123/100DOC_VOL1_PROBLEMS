You want to build some obstacle courses. You are given a 0-indexed integer array obstacles of length n, where obstacles[i] describes the height of the ith obstacle.

For every index i between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), find the length of the longest obstacle course in obstacles such that:

You choose any number of obstacles between 0 and i inclusive.
You must include the ith obstacle in the course.
You must put the chosen obstacles in the same order as they appear in obstacles.
Every obstacle (except the first) is taller than or the same height as the obstacle immediately before it.
Return an array ans of length n, where ans[i] is the length of the longest obstacle course for index i as described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: obstacles = [1,2,3,2]
Output: [1,2,3,3]
Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
- i = 0: [1], [1] has length 1.
- i = 1: [1,2], [1,2] has length 2.
- i = 2: [1,2,3], [1,2,3] has length 3.
- i = 3: [1,2,3,2], [1,2,2] has length 3.
Example 2:

Input: obstacles = [2,2,1]
Output: [1,2,1]
Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
- i = 0: [2], [2] has length 1.
- i = 1: [2,2], [2,2] has length 2.
- i = 2: [2,2,1], [1] has length 1.
Example 3:

Input: obstacles = [3,1,5,6,4,2]
Output: [1,1,2,3,2,2]
Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
- i = 0: [3], [3] has length 1.
- i = 1: [3,1], [1] has length 1.
- i = 2: [3,1,5], [3,5] has length 2. [1,5] is also valid.
- i = 3: [3,1,5,6], [3,5,6] has length 3. [1,5,6] is also valid.
- i = 4: [3,1,5,6,4], [3,4] has length 2. [1,4] is also valid.
- i = 5: [3,1,5,6,4,2], [1,2] has length 2.
 

Constraints:

n == obstacles.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= obstacles[i] <= 10^7

```cpp
class Solution{
  public:
    vector<int> longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(vector<int>& obstacles) {
    int n = obstacles.size(); // Get the size of the input array
    vector<int> dp, ans; // Initialize two vectors to store dynamic programming values and answer
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { // Loop through each obstacle in the input array
        int idx = upper_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), obstacles[i]) - dp.begin(); // Find the index where the current obstacle should be inserted in dp vector using binary search
        if (idx == dp.size()) { // If the index is equal to dp's size, it means we need to add the current obstacle to the end of dp vector
            dp.push_back(obstacles[i]);
        } else { // Otherwise, we need to update the obstacle at the index where the current obstacle should be inserted to the current obstacle
            dp[idx] = obstacles[i];
        }
        ans.push_back(idx + 1); // Add the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence that ends with the current obstacle to the answer vector
    }
    return ans; // Return the answer vector
  }
};
