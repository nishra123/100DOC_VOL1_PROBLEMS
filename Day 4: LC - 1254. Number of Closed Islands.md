Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.

Return the number of closed islands.

 

Example 1:



Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).
Example 2:



Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100
0 <= grid[i][j] <=1

INSIGHTS - Solved this question using Depth- First search... was my first time so had to refer solution once!

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int closedIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        int count = 0;
        
        // Initialize the visited vector with the correct size
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
        
        // Mark all cells that are part of an island
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 0 && !visited[i][j]) {
                    bool is_closed = dfs(grid, visited, i, j, m, n);
                    if (is_closed) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    bool dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<bool>>& visited, int i, int j, int m, int n) {
        // Check if we have reached the boundary of the grid
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= m || j >= n) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Check if we have already visited this cell or if it is water
        if (visited[i][j] || grid[i][j] == 1) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Mark this cell as visited
        visited[i][j] = true;
        
        // Recursively search all neighboring cells
        bool up = dfs(grid, visited, i-1, j, m, n);
        bool down = dfs(grid, visited, i+1, j, m, n);
        bool left = dfs(grid, visited, i, j-1, m, n);
        bool right = dfs(grid, visited, i, j+1, m, n);
        
        // Check if this island is closed
        return up && down && left && right;
    }
};
