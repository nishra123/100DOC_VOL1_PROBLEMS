A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits s and all we know is that all integers in the array were in the range [1, k] and there are no leading zeros in the array.

Given the string s and the integer k, return the number of the possible arrays that can be printed as s using the mentioned program. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1000", k = 10000
Output: 1
Explanation: The only possible array is [1000]
Example 2:

Input: s = "1000", k = 10
Output: 0
Explanation: There cannot be an array that was printed this way and has all integer >= 1 and <= 10.
Example 3:

Input: s = "1317", k = 2000
Output: 8
Explanation: Possible arrays are [1317],[131,7],[13,17],[1,317],[13,1,7],[1,31,7],[1,3,17],[1,3,1,7]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only digits and does not contain leading zeros.
1 <= k <= 10^9


INSIGHTS - Solved it using dp!

```cpp
Class Solution{
public:
int countArrays(string s, int k) {
    int n = s.size();
    // Define a constant for the modulo value
    const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    // Initialize a dynamic programming array with n+1 elements, where dp[i] is
    // the number of possible arrays that can be printed from the first i characters
    // of the string s
    vector<int> dp(n+1);

    // The base case is when there are no characters in the string, in which case there
    // is only one possible array (the empty array)
    dp[0] = 1;

    // Loop over all characters in the string, from left to right
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // Loop over all possible starting positions for the current substring, from
        // right to left. We only need to consider substrings of at most 9 characters,
        // since all integers in the array are in the range [1, k]
        for (int j = i; j >= 1 && j >= i-9; j--) {
            // If the first character of the substring is '0', we cannot form a valid
            // array from this substring, so we skip it
            if (s[j-1] == '0') {
                continue;
            }

            // Convert the substring to an integer using the stol() function
            long long num = stol(s.substr(j-1, i-j+1));

            // If the integer is within the range [1, k], we can form a new array
            // from the current substring, by appending it to the end of one of the
            // arrays formed from the previous substrings (dp[j-1])
            if (num <= k) {
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j-1]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    // Return the number of possible arrays that can be formed from the entire string
    return dp[n];
  }
};
```
