There is a directed graph of n colored nodes and m edges. The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are given a string colors where colors[i] is a lowercase English letter representing the color of the ith node in this graph (0-indexed). You are also given a 2D array edges where edges[j] = [aj, bj] indicates that there is a directed edge from node aj to node bj.

A valid path in the graph is a sequence of nodes x1 -> x2 -> x3 -> ... -> xk such that there is a directed edge from xi to xi+1 for every 1 <= i < k. The color value of the path is the number of nodes that are colored the most frequently occurring color along that path.

Return the largest color value of any valid path in the given graph, or -1 if the graph contains a cycle.

 

Example 1:



Input: colors = "abaca", edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The path 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 contains 3 nodes that are colored "a" (red in the above image).
Example 2:



Input: colors = "a", edges = [[0,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is a cycle from 0 to 0.
 

Constraints:

n == colors.length
m == edges.length
1 <= n <= 105
0 <= m <= 105
colors consists of lowercase English letters.
0 <= aj, bj < n

INSIGHTS - This was a tough question, so had to refer solution for it, which said:
The main idea of the code is to use a topological sorting algorithm to traverse the graph and keep track of the maximum color value along any valid path. We use a 2D vector count to keep track of the frequency of each color encountered on each node. Initially, all nodes with indegree zero are pushed into the queue q. Then, we perform a BFS on the graph by popping nodes from the queue and updating the count for each neighbor node.

The variable answer keeps track of the maximum color frequency seen so far, and we update it whenever we visit a node. The variable nodesSeen keeps track of the number of nodes visited so far, and we use it to check if all nodes have been visited at the end of the BFS. If not, then there is a cycle in the graph, and we return -1. Otherwise, we return the maximum color frequency.


```cpp
int largestPathValue(string colors, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
    int n = colors.length();
    vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
    vector<int> indegree(n);

    // Build the adjacency list and calculate the indegree of each node.
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        indegree[edge[1]]++;
    }

    // Initialize a 2D vector to keep track of the frequency of each color on each node.
    vector<vector<int>> count(n, vector<int>(26));
    queue<int> q;

    // Push all the nodes with indegree zero in the queue.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (indegree[i] == 0) {
            q.push(i);
        }
    }

    int answer = 0, nodesSeen = 0;
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        answer = max(answer, ++count[node][colors[node] - 'a']);
        nodesSeen++;

        // Update the count for each neighbor node.
        for (auto& neighbor : adj[node]) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                count[neighbor][i] = max(count[neighbor][i], count[node][i]);
            }

            // Decrement the indegree of neighbor and push it to the queue if its indegree becomes zero.
            indegree[neighbor]--;
            if (indegree[neighbor] == 0) {
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    // If not all nodes are visited, then there is a cycle in the graph and we return -1.
    // Otherwise, we return the maximum color frequency.
    return nodesSeen < n ? -1 : answer;
}
```
