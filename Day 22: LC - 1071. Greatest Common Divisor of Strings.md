For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

 

Example 1:

Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
Output: "ABC"
Example 2:

Input: str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"
Output: "AB"
Example 3:

Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
Output: ""
 

Constraints:

1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000
str1 and str2 consist of English uppercase letters.


INSIGHTS - This was a bit tricky question though as we had to operate with substrings of a string.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string gcdOfStrings(string str1, string str2) {
        // If the concatenation of str1 and str2 is not equal to the concatenation of str2 and str1,
        // then there is no common divisor between str1 and str2
        if (str1 + str2 != str2 + str1) {
            return "";
        }

        // Find the length of the greatest common divisor of the lengths of str1 and str2
        int gcdLength = gcd(str1.size(), str2.size());

        // Return the substring of str1 of length gcdLength
        return str1.substr(0, gcdLength);
    }
};
```
