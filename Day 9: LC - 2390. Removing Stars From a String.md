You are given a string s, which contains stars *.

In one operation, you can:

Choose a star in s.
Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.
Return the string after all stars have been removed.

Note:

The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes "lecoe".
There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".
Example 2:

Input: s = "erase*****"
Output: ""
Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters and stars *.
The operation above can be performed on s.

INSIGHTS - Used two-pointer approach described as follows:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeStars(string s) {
        int i=0,j=0; // initialize two pointers i and j to 0
        for(i=0;i<s.size();i++){ // loop through the input string
            if(s[i]=='*'){ // if the current character is a star
                j--; // decrement j to remove the non-star character to its left
            }else{
                s[j++] = s[i]; // otherwise, copy the current character to the current position of j and increment j
            }
        }
        return s.substr(0,j); // return the string up to the new value of j (which indicates the length of the new string)
    }
};
```
