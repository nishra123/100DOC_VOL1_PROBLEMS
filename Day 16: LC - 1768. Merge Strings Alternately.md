You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
Example 3:

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
 

Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        int i=0,j=0, n=word1.length(), m=word2.length();
        string ans;
        while(i<n || j<m){
            if(i<n){
                // If i < m, it means that we have not completely traversed word1. As a result, we append word1[i] to result. We increment i to point to next index of words
                ans.push_back(word1[i++]);
            }
            if(j<m){
                // If j < n, it means that we have not completely traversed word2. As a result, we append word2[j] to result. We increment j to point to next index of words
                ans.push_back(word2[j++]);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
