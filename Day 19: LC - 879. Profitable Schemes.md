There is a group of n members, and a list of various crimes they could commit. The ith crime generates a profit[i] and requires group[i] members to participate in it. If a member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.

Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least minProfit profit, and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most n.

Return the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, minProfit = 3, group = [2,2], profit = [2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: To make a profit of at least 3, the group could either commit crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.
In total, there are 2 schemes.
Example 2:

Input: n = 10, minProfit = 5, group = [2,3,5], profit = [6,7,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: To make a profit of at least 5, the group could commit any crimes, as long as they commit one.
There are 7 possible schemes: (0), (1), (2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and (0,1,2).
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
0 <= minProfit <= 100
1 <= group.length <= 100
1 <= group[i] <= 100
profit.length == group.length
0 <= profit[i] <= 100


INSIGHTS - solved it using dp!

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int profitableSchemes(int n, int minProfit, vector<int>& group, vector<int>& profit) {
        int len = group.size(), MOD = (int)1e9 + 7;
        // Initialize a 3D DP array with dimensions len+1, n+1, and minProfit+1
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(len + 1, vector<vector<int>>(n + 1, vector<int>(minProfit + 1)));
        // Base case: there is exactly one way to achieve zero profit with zero members and zero crimes
        dp[0][0][0] = 1;
        // Iterate through all crimes
        for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
            // Get the number of members and profit for this crime
            int members = group[i - 1], earn = profit[i - 1];
            // Iterate through all possible values of j (number of members) and k (minimum profit)
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k <= minProfit; k++) {
                    // If there aren't enough members to do this crime, just copy from the previous crime
                    if (j < members) {
                        dp[i][j][k] = dp[i - 1][j][k];
                    } else {
                        // Two options: include this crime or not include it
                        // If we don't include the crime, use dp[i-1][j][k]
                        // If we include the crime, use dp[i-1][j-members][max(0, k-earn)]
                        // The max function is used to ensure that k doesn't become negative
                        dp[i][j][k] = (dp[i - 1][j][k] + dp[i - 1][j - members][max(0, k - earn)]) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // Sum up all dp[len][j][minProfit] to get the total number of profitable schemes
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            sum = (sum + dp[len][j][minProfit]) % MOD;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
