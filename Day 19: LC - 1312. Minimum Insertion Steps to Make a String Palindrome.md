Given a string s. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.

Return the minimum number of steps to make s palindrome.

A Palindrome String is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "zzazz"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already palindrome we do not need any insertions.
Example 2:

Input: s = "mbadm"
Output: 2
Explanation: String can be "mbdadbm" or "mdbabdm".
Example 3:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 5
Explanation: Inserting 5 characters the string becomes "leetcodocteel".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.


INSIGHTS - Solved it using dp!

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minInsertions(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        // Initialize a 2D DP array with dimensions n+1 and n+1
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(n+1));
        // Base case: for substrings of length 1, the answer is always 0
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = 0;
        }
        // Iterate through all possible substring lengths
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
            // Iterate through all possible starting indices
            for (int i = 1; i <= n - len + 1; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1; // Ending index
                // If the characters at the start and end of the substring match, no insertion is needed
                if (s[i-1] == s[j-1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1];
                } else {
                    // Two options: insert a character at the beginning or end of the substring
                    // Choose the option that requires fewer insertions
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        // The answer is the minimum number of insertions needed to make the entire string palindrome
        return dp[1][n];
    }
};
```
