Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
nums.length == n + 1
1 <= nums[i] <= n
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
 

Follow up:

How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?


INSIGHTS - This question can be solved in different ways normally such as sorting, hashmap, bit manipulation;
but according to constraints binary search and Floyd's cycle detection method (tortoise-hare method) are suitable.


Approach 1 : USING BINARY SEARCH

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to count the number of elements in the array that are less than or equal to mid
    int findNumbersSmallerThan(vector<int>& nums, int mid){
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++){
            if(nums[i]<=mid){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int start=0, end=nums.size()-1, mid=0;
        while(start<end){
            // Find the middle element of the array
            int mid= (start+end)/2;
            
            // If the number of elements in the array that are less than or equal to mid
            // is greater than mid, then the repeated number must be in the range [start, mid]
            if(findNumbersSmallerThan(nums,mid)>mid){
                end=mid;
            }
            // Otherwise, the repeated number must be in the range [mid+1, end]
            else{
                start=mid+1;
            }
        }
        // Return the repeated number
        return start;
    }
};
```


Approach 2: USIING FLOYD'S CYCLE DETECTION METHOD (TORTOISE-HARE METHOD)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Find the intersection point of the two runners.
        // Initialize the tortoise and hare to the first value in the array.
        int tortoise = nums[0];
        int hare = nums[0];
        
        // Use a do-while loop to move the tortoise one step at a time and the hare two steps at a time
        // until they meet inside the cycle.
        do {
            tortoise = nums[tortoise]; // Move the tortoise one step.
            hare = nums[nums[hare]]; // Move the hare two steps.
        } while (tortoise != hare);
        
        // Find the "entrance" to the cycle.
        // Reset the tortoise to the beginning of the array, while keeping the hare at the intersection point.
        tortoise = nums[0];
        while (tortoise != hare) { // Move the tortoise and hare one step at a time until they meet at the entrance point.
            tortoise = nums[tortoise];
            hare = nums[hare];
        }
        
        // Return the duplicate value.
        return hare;
    }
};
```

The code above implements Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to find the duplicate number in the given array of integers. The algorithm treats the array as a linked list, where the value at each index is the node and the value itself is the next index to traverse. 

The algorithm first finds the intersection point of two pointers, the tortoise (moves 1 step at a time) and the hare (moves 2 steps at a time). Once they meet, it is guaranteed that they are inside a cycle. 

Then, the tortoise is reset to the beginning of the array while the hare remains at the intersection point. They both move one step at a time until they meet again, this time at the entrance of the cycle. This entrance point is the duplicate value that we are looking for in the array. 

Finally, the duplicate value is returned. The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity and uses constant space, as it only stores two pointers.
