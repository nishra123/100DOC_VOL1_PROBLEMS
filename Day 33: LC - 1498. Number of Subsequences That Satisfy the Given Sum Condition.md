You are given an array of integers nums and an integer target.

Return the number of non-empty subsequences of nums such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal to target. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,5,6,7], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 subsequences that satisfy the condition.
[3] -> Min value + max value <= target (3 + 3 <= 9)
[3,5] -> (3 + 5 <= 9)
[3,5,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
[3,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,3,6,8], target = 10
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 subsequences that satisfy the condition. (nums can have repeated numbers).
[3] , [3] , [3,3], [3,6] , [3,6] , [3,3,6]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,3,3,4,6,7], target = 12
Output: 61
Explanation: There are 63 non-empty subsequences, two of them do not satisfy the condition ([6,7], [7]).
Number of valid subsequences (63 - 2 = 61).
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
1 <= target <= 10^6


INSIGHTS - Solved using two pointer approach.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSubseq(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        // Sort the input array in non-decreasing order
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        // Get the size of the input array
        int n = nums.size();
        // Initialize two pointers, one pointing to the leftmost element and one pointing to the rightmost element
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        // Initialize a variable to keep track of the result
        int res = 0;
        // Loop until the left pointer is greater than the right pointer
        while (left <= right) {
            // If the sum of the minimum and maximum element on the current subsequence is greater than the target,
            // decrement the right pointer
            if (nums[left] + nums[right] > target) {
                right--;
            } 
            // If the sum of the minimum and maximum element on the current subsequence is less than or equal to the target,
            // update the result by adding the number of subsequence that can be formed with the current left and right pointers
            // and increment the left pointer
            else {
                // Calculate the number of subsequences that can be formed with the current left and right pointers
                // the number of subsequences formed are 2^(right-left)
                // using the pow2 function defined below
                res = (res + pow2(right - left, MOD)) % MOD;
                left++;
            }
        }
        // Return the result
        return res;
    }
    
    // Helper function to calculate the power of 2
    long long pow2(int exponent, long long mod) {

        long long base = 2;
        while (exponent > 0) {
            if (exponent % 2 == 1) {
                result = (result * base) % mod;
            }
            base = (base * base) % mod;
