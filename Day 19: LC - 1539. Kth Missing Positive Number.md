Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.

Return the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
1 <= k <= 1000
arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length
 

Follow up:

Could you solve this problem in less than O(n) complexity?

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findKthPositive(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int start=0, end=arr.size()-1;
        while(start<=end){
            int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
            if(arr[mid] - mid - 1 <k){
                start = mid+1;
            }
            else{
                end =mid-1;
            }
        }
        return start+k;
    }
};
```


INSIGHTS - I like this question a lot as it uses Binary Search with a twist- and it was - POSITIONS OF ELEMENTS IN A SORTED ARRAY.

The expression arr[mid] - (mid + 1) calculates the number of missing integers between the start of the array and the middle element. Here's why:

In a sorted array of positive integers, each element should be one greater than the previous element. For example, if the first element is 1, the second element should be 2, the third element should be 3, and so on. If an element is missing from the array, it means that there is a gap between the previous element and the current element.

Let's consider the array [1, 3, 4, 7, 9] as an example. The number of missing integers between the start of the array and the first element is 0. The number of missing integers between the start of the array and the second element is 1, because there is a gap of size 1 between 1 and 3. The number of missing integers between the start of the array and the third element is also 1, because there is no gap between 3 and 4. The number of missing integers between the start of the array and the fourth element is 2, because there are gaps of size 1 and 2 between 4 and 7. The number of missing integers between the start of the array and the fifth element is 4, because there are gaps of size 1, 2, and 3 between 7 and 9.

To generalize this, we can say that the number of missing integers up to the ith element of the array is equal to arr[i] - (i + 1). This is because arr[i] is the value of the ith element, and (i + 1) is the expected value of the ith element if there were no missing integers. Subtracting (i + 1) from arr[i] gives us the number of missing integers up to the ith element.

Therefore, in the binary search solution, we calculate arr[mid] - (mid + 1), which is the number of missing integers up to the middle element. We use this value to determine whether to search in the left sub-array or the right sub-array, based on whether missingCount is greater than or equal to k.
