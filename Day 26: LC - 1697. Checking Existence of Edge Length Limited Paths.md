An undirected graph of n nodes is defined by edgeList, where edgeList[i] = [ui, vi, disi] denotes an edge between nodes ui and vi with distance disi. Note that there may be multiple edges between two nodes.

Given an array queries, where queries[j] = [pj, qj, limitj], your task is to determine for each queries[j] whether there is a path between pj and qj such that each edge on the path has a distance strictly less than limitj .

Return a boolean array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and the jth value of answer is true if there is a path for queries[j] is true, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 3, edgeList = [[0,1,2],[1,2,4],[2,0,8],[1,0,16]], queries = [[0,1,2],[0,2,5]]
Output: [false,true]
Explanation: The above figure shows the given graph. Note that there are two overlapping edges between 0 and 1 with distances 2 and 16.
For the first query, between 0 and 1 there is no path where each distance is less than 2, thus we return false for this query.
For the second query, there is a path (0 -> 1 -> 2) of two edges with distances less than 5, thus we return true for this query.
Example 2:


Input: n = 5, edgeList = [[0,1,10],[1,2,5],[2,3,9],[3,4,13]], queries = [[0,4,14],[1,4,13]]
Output: [true,false]
Exaplanation: The above figure shows the given graph.
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 105
1 <= edgeList.length, queries.length <= 10^5
edgeList[i].length == 3
queries[j].length == 3
0 <= ui, vi, pj, qj <= n - 1
ui != vi
pj != qj
1 <= disi, limitj <= 10^9
There may be multiple edges between two nodes.


INSIGHTS - Used a new data structure called Disjoint- Set Union (DSU); which is implemented as follows:

```cpp
class DSU {
    public:
    vector<int> Parent, Rank;
    DSU(int n) {
        Parent.resize(n);
        Rank.resize(n, 0);
        // Initialize each node's parent to itself
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) Parent[i] = i;
    }
    // Find the parent of a node and compress the path
    int Find(int x) {
        return Parent[x] = Parent[x] == x ? x : Find(Parent[x]);
    }
    // Merge two sets and return true if they were disjoint
    bool Union(int x, int y) {
        int xset = Find(x), yset = Find(y);
        if (xset != yset) {
            // Rank-based union to keep tree balanced
            Rank[xset] < Rank[yset] ? Parent[xset] = yset : Parent[yset] = xset;
            Rank[xset] += Rank[xset] == Rank[yset];
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> distanceLimitedPathsExist(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edgeList, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        // Create a DSU with n nodes
        DSU dsu(n);
        // Add an index to each query to track their original order
        for(int i=0;i<queries.size();i++)
            queries[i].push_back(i);
        
        // Sort the queries and edgeList by limit and weight respectively
        sort(queries.begin(), queries.end(), [&](auto const &a, auto const &b){
            return a[2] < b[2];
        });
        sort(edgeList.begin(), edgeList.end(), [&](auto const &a, auto const &b){
            return a[2] < b[2];
        });
        
        int i=0;
        // Initialize the result vector
        vector<bool> res(queries.size(), false);
        // Iterate through the sorted queries
        for(auto q: queries){
            // Add edges with weight less than the current query's limit
            while(i<edgeList.size() && edgeList[i][2]<q[2]){
                dsu.Union(edgeList[i][0] , edgeList[i][1]);
                i++;
            }
            
            // Check if the start and end nodes of the current query are in the same connected component
            if(dsu.Find(q[0]) == dsu.Find(q[1]))
                // If a path exists, set the corresponding entry in the result vector to true
                res[q[3]] = true;
        }
        
        // Return the result vector
        return res;
    }
};
